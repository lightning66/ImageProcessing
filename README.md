# ImageProcessing

To use the app, just donwload the "exe" file (It can be used on Windows only). Open the ".exe" file, browse your local disk to select an image that includes text. It will convert the text portion to editable text and output a ".txt" file with the file name same as your image.

If you want to implement the Python code in MacOS or Linux, I have included the source files in the "Code" folder.
